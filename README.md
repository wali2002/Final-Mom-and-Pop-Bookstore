# Final-Mom-and-Pop-Bookstore

E_Library has a really simple and user-friendly design, 
which provides the users a very different approach to easily do the browsing and surfing through the entire store. 
Once the user first accesses our website they are automatically directed to our welcome page in which they can search for a book, 
sign in/register into their account, and use other tabs to go to other pages etc. 
Then it depends on what the user is looking for, they might want to try to search by the name of the author, title or in all. 
We have also implemented an advanced search in case to make it easier for the user if there is a specific book they are looking for. 
In the search result page, the user can also sort based on the title, author and price. 
Another thing the user is able to do is that they can narrow down the search by selecting a specific category inside this result page. 
Once the search results appear then the user can select a particular book for more details about it, 
which also includes the user reviews for that book. 
Then the user is also able to add a specific book into their shopping cart, 
and from there they can order the book by entering the required information for processing the order. 
Furthermore, users are also able to review or rate a specific book they have read already.
Any user is eligible to create an account by registering on the Register User page and only the signed users are able to purchase a 
book or add a review. Our online website store is also equipped with resources such as help/faqs to assist our users. 
For example, there is a help page where we have answered most frequently asked questions to help the users. Moreover, 
if the user has their own questions that are not answered or they want to contact us for any further information then they can also 
contact us using our Contact Us page. We have an About Us page that tells about our store and our development team.
